Given two blackjack hands (A, B), Score each blackjack hand.

Comparing Scores:
If either hand > 21 it loses.  
	If one hand remains it wins.
	End
Compare the two scores to each other.
	If A > B
		A wins
	If B > A
		B wins
	If A == B 
		Tie
End

Score a hand:
Let S tally the score, initialized at 0.
Let A tally the Aces in the hand, initialized at zero.
For each card in the hand:
	If card rank is in (JACK, QUEEN, KING) 
		cardValue = 10
	If card rank == ACE
		cardValue = 1
		A = A + 1
	Else
		cardValue = card rank
	S = S + cardValue
While ((S+10)<=21) && (A > 0)
	S = S + 10
	A = A -1
The resulting value of S is the handâ€™s score.
End Score.
